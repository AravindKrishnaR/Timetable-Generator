# Timetable-Generator
A timetable generator Webapp developed as part of the Software Engineering project.

1. You'll need a localhost to run the website, we used xampp for this purpose.

2. You'll have to import the database(timetable.sql.gz) into your local server(localhost/phpmyadmin.com) and name the database as timetable.

3. The file containing the code will have to be saved inside this directory C:\xampp\htdocs, if you are using xampp.

4. Then you are set to run the website.

5. Go to the folder containing google chrome. And open command prompt in that directory and enter this code in cmd, 
.\chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files.This should open chrome. 

6. Now enter localhost in chrome and select the folder containing the project code(Timetable Generator).

7. It should lead to the website.
